# Point of Sales (POS) system in Python
I created a pont of sales system for ordering food. The system is integrated with telegram's telebot function, where it sends each order to the bot chat automatically.

## Python Packages
1. numpy
3. pandas
4. tabulate
5. requests

## Excel Files
You can freely change the item names and prices inside the excel files "breakfast.xslx", "lunch.xlsx", "dinner.xlsx", "drinks.xlsx" and "snacks.xlsx". 

## Telebot (Optional)
I have commented out line 264-265 which is the messaging part. To use the telebot function, simply replace "your_API" and "your_chat_id" with your own API and chat id generated by the telegram. For more information on how to set up a bot chat, please see the official [documentation](https://core.telegram.org/bots).
